# The pre-push gate, run by .githooks/pre-push.hooks. git writes one line per
# pushed ref on stdin, `<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>`, and
# git-std forwards them. A push that holds only tags (a release tag, or the
# deletion of one) changes no branch, so the gate is skipped; any other push
# runs `just pre-push`. An empty stdin, from a push with nothing to update or
# from lines that were lost, also runs the gate. xtask/tests/pre_push_gate.rs
# checks this script.
